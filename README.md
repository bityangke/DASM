# Damage Assessment System For Image Data (DASM)

## Abstract
Damage assessment after disasters is an important task for governments and organizations, howeverit takes a lot of time to evaluate the damage especially if the disaster affected a large area. In this project we propose a solution for this problem by employing image classification methods on damaged structures. We gathered data from the web and categorized them to build the training dataset. We use deep convolutional neural network(CNN), support vector machine(SVM) and bag-of-visual-words(BoVW) models.
